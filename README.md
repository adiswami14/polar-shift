# polar-shift
A tool for the visualization of political polarization in the United States, and the shift of voting trends for the past couple of presidential elections. Currently, this displays 2 plots (the shift of political ideologies on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate since 1880). Furthermore, it generates election plots for each presidential election since 1976 (this includes the 2020 election). For the plots on polarization, please reference the `Rplots.pdf` file. In-depth documentation still remains to be done.

## Results

Check out this gif to see how the election plot works:
